## Research Problem

Cut flowers and ornemantal plants are key products in Sri Lanka's floriculture industry, but beginner growers often struggle with:
- Selecting suitable crops based on **weather, resources, and expected yield**
- Identifying different **Philodendron varieties** used in tissue culture and foliage décor

❌ Poor decisions result in time, money, and resource losses  
❌ Lack of expert guidance for new growers  
✅ This app bridges this gap with **accessible technology**
