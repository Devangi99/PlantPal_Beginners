# PlantPal_"For Beginners"
A cross-platform mobile application developed as part of a final year research project, aimed at assisting beginners in Sri Lankan floriculture with **cut flower crop selection** and **Philodendron variety identification** using affordable technologies.

## Research Problem

Cut flowers and ornemantal plants are key products in Sri Lanka's floriculture industry, but beginner growers often struggle with:
- Selecting suitable crops based on **weather, resources, and expected yield**
- Identifying different **Philodendron varieties** used in tissue culture and foliage d√©cor

‚ùå Poor decisions result in time, money, and resource losses  
‚ùå Lack of expert guidance for new growers  
‚úÖ This app bridges this gap with **accessible technology**
